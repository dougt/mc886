youtube.seer.sqlite has some problems with pages: though I accessed youtube.com/
and not www.youtube.com/, all subresources point to www.youtube.com. So
www.youtube.com/ is not in moz_pages, and youtube.com is not in the hosts.

- Fix histograms
- Calculate dispersion and find K
- New subresources start at the upper right cluster, which tends to get big. Do
  we want that? Maybe use number of pages as a feature as well?
- Give some examples for each cluster.
