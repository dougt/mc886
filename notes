Histogram to determine K
SVM scaling
Online k-means
Pagerank?
What happens with resources that are shared among lots of pages?
    - They will float to the second quadrant and might form a cluster
      of their own, what to do with them?
    - On the other hand, it's pretty obvious they are "hot" resources,
      so it could be worth it to just predict them always anyway
When we update a subresource, how to remove it from on-line k-means?

Timestamp:
    - Use timestamp long in the future?
    - Use number of weeks/days/hours since epoch?
    - Normalize using current time? (current - timestamp) / hours?
    - Decompose timestamp in number of days, hours and minutes?

youtube.seer.sqlite has some problems with pages: though I accessed youtube.com/
and not www.youtube.com/, all subresources point to www.youtube.com. So
www.youtube.com/ is not in moz_pages, and youtube.com is not in the hosts.
